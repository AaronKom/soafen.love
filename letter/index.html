Dear Dr. Bob Loblaw,<br>
<br>
Thank you for your sample delivery kit, it was very helpful for the purposes it held.<br>
<br>
I am writing to inform you of a recent discovery made by my brother-in-law Charlie Jansson. In a phone call earlier this morning, we were discussing current world affairs when it came to my attention that my usage of the popular text editor 'nano' was adversely affecting both my mental and physical health.<br><br>
Charlie has been guiding me through the transition to a different text editor 'vim' which has been medically proven to improve the mental and physical wellbeing of its users. In fact, I am using it right now to compose this very letter, LUL!<br><br>
I need to finish writing for now so that I can watch the Haiku with my family tonight - I appreciate your patience.<br>
<br>
Hoping to hear from you at your earliest convenience.<br>
Jimbo Jenkins<br>
