## Usage of IcoMoon
i opt to use IcoMoon over something like FontAwesome because of a few key benefits:
- not loading like 7 icons from a cdn with thousands of icons
- being able to self-host the font and cut down reliability on another third party
- FontAwesome bad

a quick rundown to using IcoMoon is as follows:
1. Go to https://icomoon.io/app/#/select
2. Click 'Import Icons' at the top left
3. Import `icomoon/icomoon.eot`
4. Add and remove icons and/or icon packs as necessary
5. Generate and Download the font on the bottom right
6. Replace the files in the icomoon folder of the site
7. Retain selection.json for the ability to re-import your icons at a later date
8. Use the font glyph id's visible on the demo page downloaded along with your font files
